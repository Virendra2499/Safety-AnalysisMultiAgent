🛡 Automated Safety Requirement Analysis using RAG & Generative AI
This project uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a multi-agent architecture to analyze safety-critical system descriptions against predefined safety requirements. It leverages Google Gemini (Generative AI), FAISS vector search, and Python to automate compliance checks in domains like robotics, automotive, or industrial automation.

🧠 How It Works
The pipeline consists of:

💾 FAISS Vector Store: stores embedded safety requirements for fast similarity search.

🔍 Agent 1 (Retriever): identifies the most relevant safety requirements for a given system description.

🧪 Agent 2 (Analyzer): uses Gemini LLM to assess if the system description complies with the requirements.

📝 Agent 3 (Reporter): generates a structured safety compliance report using the analysis.

All components run locally in your Codespace using Python and Gemini via API.

🧪 Example Input
System Description:

“The PLC controls all safety interlocks. In case of mechanical failure or fault detection, it instantly disables motor drives via relay contactors.”

Agent 1 retrieves:
“The system shall cease motor operation if a fault is received from the safety PLC.”

Agent 2 evaluates:
Compliance = ✅ COMPLIANT

Agent 3 generates a report including:

Requirement

Compliance Status

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repo or open the Codespace.

Add your Gemini API key to config.py (see below).

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the pipeline:

python main.py

🔐 API Key Setup
config.py

GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_gemini_api_key_here"
